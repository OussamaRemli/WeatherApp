## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WeatherApp.git
```

### Setup WeatherAPI
1. Sign up at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Replace the API key in `MainActivity.java`:
```java
String url = "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q=" + cityName + "&days=1&aqi=no&alerts=no";
```

### Firebase Configuration
1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add an Android app to your Firebase project
3. Download and add the `google-services.json` to your project's `app` directory

### Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are added to your `build.gradle`:
- Volley for API requests
- Picasso for image loading
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Authentication

## Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
- Internet access

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Android SDK
- WeatherAPI
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Volley
- Picasso

## App Structure
- `MainActivity.java`: Main activity handling location, weather fetching, and UI updates
- `WeatherRVAdapter.java`: RecyclerView adapter for hourly forecast
- `WeatherRVModal.java`: Data model for weather information

## How It Works
1. App detects user's current location
2. Fetches weather data from WeatherAPI
3. Displays current weather and hourly forecast
4. Stores forecast data in Firebase Realtime Database
5. Allows manual city search
